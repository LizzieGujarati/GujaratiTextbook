For the simple present tense sentence “I walk” (simple) or “I am walking” (continuous) we would say: Hu chalu chuહું ચાલું છું Simple and continuous are the same only in positive present tense sentences. For speaking in first person, we remove the verb ending “vanu” and added an “u” to the end. We can also add an “e,” “ie” or “o” to the verb instead when we use the other pronouns. This matches the tense word from the last section - “chalu chu,” “chale che,” “chalie chie,” “chalo cho.” Table 1.6: To walk, present tense Category English Pronoun Verb Tense word First person I walk Hu હું chalu ચાલું chu છું Second person informal You walk Tu તું chale ચાલે che છે Second person formal You walk Tame તમે chalo ચાલો cho છો Second person plural You all walk Tame badha તમે બધાં chalo ચાલો cho છો Third person singular They walk E એ / Te તે chale ચાલે che છે Third person formal They walk Teo તેઓ chale ચાલે che છે Third person plural They walk Teo તેઓ chale ચાલે che છે First person plural inclusive We walk Aapne આપણે chalie ચાલીએ chie છીએ First person plural exclusive We walk Ame અમે chalie ચાલીએ chie છીએ 1.4.1 Common verbs Here are some common verbs to start with: Table 1.7: Common verbs To go: javanu (જવાનું) 🚶 To see: jovanu (જોવાનું) 👀 To smile: hasvanu (હસવાનું) 😀 To speak: bolvanu(બોલવાનું) 💬 To write: lakhvanu(લખવાનું) 📝 To read: vaachavanu(વાંચવાનું) 📚 To sleep: unghavanu (ઊંઘવાનું) 💤 To get up: uthavanu (ઉઠવાનું) ⏰ To do work: kam karvanu (કામ કરવાનું) 💼 Notice the last one is two words - kam karvanu. The verb is karvanu (to do) and the word kam means work. So kam karvanu is to do work and the same structure can be added to other actions. For example, lagna means marry, so lagna karvanu (લગ્ન કરવાનું) means to marry. Bund means close (opposite of open) so bund karvanu (બંધ કરવાનું) means to close.
